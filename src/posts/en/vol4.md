(Before we begin, this was generated based on my voice input using Gemini. Therefore, content that the author has incorporated completely independently is inserted in parentheses (). This time, I have deliberately left Gemini's output as is. The fundamental content is mostly correct, but it is a bit thorny and incomplete. I would like you to read it including that. This is, of course, a sentence I wrote. I can't prove it, but...)

1. Why, deliberately, "Antigravity"?
Last time, I mentioned that I was "stuck after using up Cursor's free tier," and to cut to the chase, I've decided on **"Antigravity"** as my next partner.

There are a few reasons. One is simply that I couldn't physically use Cursor anymore because I never received a reply from their development team. But the bigger reason is, after all, its **"name."**

"Antigravity." This really fits my current mood.

At first, I thought that by using the famous Cursor that everyone uses, I could experience the forefront of development. It's certainly convenient, and its features are wonderful. But when I see everyone following suit and using Cursor or VS Code, I somehow feel that it's "not interesting." It feels like a gravity where everyone is being pulled towards a massive "correct" tool.

So, I decided to choose a tool with a name like "Antigravity," which is still an unknown quantity. "If everyone is stuck to the ground, I'll just float." Acting out such a slightly rebellious role (stance) feels right for this phase.

Well, I think it's fine to choose tools for such intuitive reasons. It's cool, after all.

2. The Doppelgänger Incident and the Moment Humans Became Unnecessary
I started using this "Antigravity" with high spirits, but I was immediately put to the test. When I tried to work on the project by opening it on both my PC and smartphone, they wouldn't connect at all.

This is the actual error on my smartphone.
What's on the screen is just a sterile error log about a "PublishAudio error" or something about parameters. Normally, this is where the tedious debugging work of copying the log, searching for it, and so on would begin.

But then I thought, "What would happen if I just threw this at the AI?" Since it was a hassle to read the log, I took a screenshot of the error screen on my smartphone and just dropped it into the Antigravity chat window. I asked casually, something like, "It's not connecting, what's this?"

It was instantaneous. The answer that came back was beyond my expectations.

"Usernames are duplicated. You are in a state of being two people (a doppelgänger) on the system, and the connection is being refused."

I was truly surprised by this. It didn't just follow the log strings; from a single image, it instantly grasped the context of "what the user was trying to do and what contradiction they fell into," and even corrected the code behind the scenes.

In that moment, I felt it intensely. **"Ah, humans are completely unnecessary for development now."**

The time we've desperately spent on things like "finding syntax errors" or "getting stuck in environment setup" is just a few seconds of calculation for an AI. I was vividly shown that it's no longer a human's job to allocate human resources there.

3. Pouring Freed-Up Resources into "Castle Building"
So, what should humans do, now that they are freed from the "work" of writing code? If AI can perfectly handle the "How (how to make it)," then what humans should do is the **"What (what to make)" and "Why (why to make it)."** In other words, it's about designing the concept and UI/UX, and creating the "experience" itself.

...That's the ideal theory, but in reality, what have I been doing these past few weeks? Instead of refining the app's concept, I've been spending my time building this blog site myself.

(↑This is of course not about note. I tried to create a site myself, though I'm an amateur, so I can promote it to the world. It's still just a skeleton, but I'm planning to keep improving it. If you're interested → https://my-lingualog-app.vercel.app/)

Honestly, if it's just about writing, I could use an existing platform like Note or Hatena Blog. That would be faster, and the chances of someone reading it would be higher. But I felt that was wrong.

(I tried putting in Gemini's output without any changes, but I didn't say anything like this at all. I just typed that I tried making another site, and this is what I got. Hmm, when I get an output like this, I can understand why people are afraid of AI. Although it's fundamentally just doing calculations and has no emotions whatsoever... By the way, it also output something that sounds like a criticism of note below, but of course, I didn't say that either. I guess you really have to think about how you interact with it.)

It didn't feel right for someone who talks about "enjoying inconvenience" in app development to use an "efficient, borrowed place" for their own communication. That's why, although I had help from AI (Antigravity) (← I didn't say I used Antigravity for this either), I deliberately built the site from scratch myself.

It might be a waste if you think about efficiency, but it's in that wasted time that the feeling of "I did this" resides. I think in the coming era, how we design such **"lovable waste"** will become conversely important.

4. "LinguaLog" and the Future BMI Off-Function
Let's get back to the app. I'm calling it "LinguaLog" for now, but it's not like I've decided on this name. I think I can think about the logo and name as I go.

In the process of development, I had an opportunity to rethink my own values. Originally, the concept was a bit stoic, like "enjoying the inefficiency of language learning," but I've realized that's not necessarily the only right answer.

In the future, as technology advances further, an era may come where we can implant chips (BMI) directly into our brains and install languages in an instant. At that time, whether to go through the trouble of memorizing vocabulary yourself or to just install it quickly is a choice you can make based on your mood and values at the time. I have no intention of denying "efficiency," and there are situations where it's better to take it easy if you can.

However, there is one non-negotiable core I want to hold onto, and that's the part about **"who you face, how you face them, and what you talk about."**

No matter how optimal the translation in your brain is, a relationship filled with "failure-free, non-hurtful conversations" generated by AI is, to me, **"shallow."** I feel that a conversation plastered with correct words lacks a human warmth.

So, what I'm thinking of for the app's concept now is a function to **"deliberately turn off BMI-like support only during conversations."** You take off the training wheels and speak with your raw words. You hesitate, make grammatical mistakes, and panic when you're not understood. A place where you can enjoy that "noise"-filled communication itself as the purpose.

Of course, some people will hate such an inconvenient function, and I think the majority will choose "convenience." But I'm not thinking of having everyone use it. People with a niche sensibility like me who feel that "a world that has become too convenient is boring." If I can create a community with such people where we can share the option of "deliberately turning it off," I think that would be one of the goals.
