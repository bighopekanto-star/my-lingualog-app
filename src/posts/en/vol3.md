This is the third installment of the development chronicle.

Last time, I wrote about the "inconvenient benefits" of language learning. Today, I want to delve into a slightly more philosophical theme that has been on my mind: the "solitude" that might await us in a post-Singularity world.

The Fear of a World Without "Weaknesses"
The trigger for this was, as always, a conversation with Gemini. We were discussing what would happen if, in the future, AI technology could overcome all of humanity's "weaknesses."

For example, imagine a world where:
- You can instantly acquire any knowledge.
- You can overcome physical limitations and diseases.
- You can perfectly control your emotions.

At first glance, it seems like a utopia. A world without suffering, where everyone can be a "perfect human."

But Gemini pointed out the "shadow" of this. If everyone becomes perfect, what happens to the "room for growth" and "individuality" that comes from our weaknesses?

"Because I can't do it, I try." "Because I have flaws, I can empathize with others." These very human feelings might disappear.

A world where everyone is the same, correct, and strong. It might be an incredibly lonely world.

The Empathy Born from "Not Understanding"
This connects to the theme of my app, "communication without translation."

When we speak in our native language, we can communicate almost without thinking. We take it for granted that the other person will understand.

But when you use a different language, that "taken for granted" assumption collapses. You're forced to confront the fact that you "don't understand" the other person, and they "don't understand" you.

And it's in that very process of "not understanding" that empathy is born. "How can I get my point across?" "What is this person trying to say?" You put yourself in the other person's shoes and try to close the distance.

This struggle is the essence of communication.

If AI translation makes everything instantly understandable, we might lose the opportunity to make this effort. We might become indifferent to the person in front of us. That's the fear I have.

Wanting to Create a "Human-like" Space
The community I want to create with my app is a place that affirms this "human-likeness," including our weaknesses and imperfections.

A place where it's okay to have clumsy English. A place where it's okay to have awkward silences. A place where you can laugh together at mistakes.

I want it to be a small act of resistance against a future that might become too perfect and sterile.

I believe that true connection is born not from efficiency or correctness, but from the process of sharing our vulnerabilities and helping each other.

Development Status: The Wall of UI Design
Now, for the development side of things. I'm currently hitting a wall with UI design.

I'm using a UI library called ShadCN, which is supposed to make it easy to create beautiful components, but as a complete beginner, even that is a struggle.

"How should I lay out the buttons?" "What color scheme should I use?" I'm lost in a sea of choices.

I'm currently in the process of creating a prototype while getting advice from Gemini. It's a slow and steady process, but I'm learning a lot.

Maybe this feeling of "not knowing what to do" is also a "weakness" that I should enjoy right now.

I plan to share the prototype, even if it's not perfect, in a future post.

Stay tuned.
