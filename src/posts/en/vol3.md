Before getting to the main topic, I have a consultation (or rather, a serious concern) I'd like to share with you, the readers.

I'm writing this blog while consulting with AI (Gemini), but don't you find that when you have AI polish your writing, it suddenly becomes too **"overconfident"**?

I'm speaking with a "I think so..." kind of tone via voice input, but the text the AI outputs sounds like a very skilled presenter, saying things like "It is...!" or "It must be...!". When I read it back, I often feel like, "Hey, that's not my character... it feels kind of weird" (lol).

Even if I ask it to "make it softer," it still feels off. If any senior bloggers who use AI have know-how like "giving this kind of instruction makes it sound natural" or "I make these kinds of adjustments," please let me know. I'm serious.

...So, while trying my best to trim the AI's "smug face," I'll write about what I was vaguely thinking about on the train today.

When you look around on the train, you see everyone looking down at their smartphones, right? Of course, I'm one of them, checking notifications whenever I have a spare moment, or scrolling through my timeline.

And at times like that, I vaguely think. "If AI and technology evolve even more, what will happen to our future?"

This time, it's not about development, but I'll try to write ramblingly about the "future things" I usually think about. I feel like there are quite a few people who have similar anxieties.

I was scared of "stopping thinking"
Until a little while ago, I was really scared of something like the "Singularity" coming.

Looking at the current smartphone addiction, I wonder what will happen to people if things become even more convenient in the future, for example, if things like "BMI" that directly connect the brain to the internet become commonplace. Getting answers before you even think, being able to speak foreign languages with a single chip without studying, and having AI do all the troublesome things for you.

If we enter such a "world where everything is done for you," won't people stop thinking for themselves? Just going with the flow, ending up in a state of suspended thought... I wondered, is there any meaning in living like that? What am I? I was despairing on my own.

According to conventional wisdom, I thought that happiness was about gaining a "sense of fulfillment" or "sense of accomplishment" as a reward for spending time and effort on something. I was very scared that this would collapse.

But maybe values just "change"
But recently, I had a thought: "Wait, maybe that's just my assumption?"

The trigger was when a student at my part-time tutoring job asked, "Won't life be boring if AI becomes widespread?" or a conversation I had while brainstorming with AI, but I somehow arrived at one idea.

"It's not that future people will be unhappy, but simply that 'values' will shift, isn't it?"

For example, it might be easier to understand if we think about the primitive era. In the old days, men risked their lives hunting mammoths, and women gathered nuts to live, right? For them, that "hunt" was the struggle for survival, and the joy of a successful hunt must have been the greatest entertainment in life.

So, are we, who buy packaged meat at the supermarket now, living a "more boring life" than primitive people? Are we beings to be pitied by primitive people, who would say "it's a shame you can't hunt"? When I think about it, I'm sure that's not the case.

Instead of hunting, we find fun in other things, like watching movies or playing games. So, I think the same thing will happen in the future.

The drama we feel now in processes like "I'm happy that my broken English was understood!" or "I'm nervous about whether my crush will reject me" is because that's the "hunt" of our time. Future people will probably find value in more direct brain-to-brain understanding or new forms of communication we can't imagine, and live happily in their own way.

When I thought about it that way, the idea that "becoming too convenient will ruin people" might just be my own selfish worry, based on the values of our current era.

Will language learning become the "horseback riding" of the future?
However, even if I understand that in my head, I'm still a person of this era. No matter how convenient things become, I still want to think for myself and communicate in my own words.

That's when I thought of the story of **"equestrianism (horseback riding)."**

In the past, horses were essential for transportation, right? To the point where you couldn't live without them. But then cars and trains were invented, and they were no longer needed as a means of transportation. So, did the culture of riding horses disappear? No, it remains as a hobby and sport called "horseback riding."

If you want to move efficiently, you should take a car. The reason people still choose to ride horses is because the **"process" itself** of feeling the wind and interacting with a living creature is fun.

I feel like "language learning" and "cross-cultural understanding" will become like this "horseback riding" in the future.

If you want to convey information efficiently for work, the right answer is to use AI translation or a brain chip. Because it's fast. But, to deliberately try to convey your message in your own clumsy words, sweating. That seems to be changing from information transmission to an entertainment for enjoying the "process of trying to understand each other."

Like "deliberately not taking a car and riding a horse," "deliberately not using AI and speaking in my own words." That might become a very luxurious form of play.

To the 10% of "eccentrics"
Of course, I think that people who think like this are in the minority. If AI evolves, I think 80% or 90% of people will go with the convenient option. I myself touch my smartphone all the time, and I want to take the easy way out. If people can be satisfied with that, I think that's totally fine.

But I think there's a certain number of **"eccentrics"** like me in the world.

People who want to feel the satisfaction of doing it themselves rather than convenience.

People who like to spend time worrying on their own rather than getting an answer right away.

People who want to get a sense of fulfillment by immersing themselves in something troublesome rather than killing time on their smartphones.

I feel like the more technology evolves, the more such people will find a stronger meaning in "deliberately choosing inconvenience." Just like there are people who deliberately listen to records or go camping even now.

I want the app I'm making to be a place for such people. It's not that I want to change the world or anything. But, I just think it would be nice to have a place where **"niche, and a little weird people"** can gather and say, "It's nice to ride a horse sometimes, right?" "Let's turn off the translator sometimes and enjoy the language barrier."

Finally
Well, I don't know what will happen from now on. In a few years, I might have a brain chip and be saying "AI is the best!" (lol).

But for now, I'm going to continue developing my app while cherishing this idea of "inconvenient benefits." If there's anyone who reads this and thinks, "Hey, I kind of get it," please be my friend.

Efficiency is good, but why don't we sometimes play together, deliberately bringing out an inconvenient "stone axe" or something?

Well then, until next time.
