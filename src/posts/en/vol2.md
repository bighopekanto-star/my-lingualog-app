It's been a while. This is the second installment of the development chronicle.

Last time, I grandly declared that I would "create an app that deliberately avoids using AI translation." Today, I want to dig a little deeper into why I think the "inconvenience" and "difficulty" of not using translation is actually a good thing.

The other day, I was talking to Gemini (Google's AI) about this, and it gave me a really interesting perspective.

The Brain is a "Reward-Seeking Machine"?
Apparently, the human brain has a mechanism called the "reward system." When we take on a challenging task and overcome it, our brains release a substance called dopamine, which makes us feel pleasure and a sense of accomplishment.

This is the so-called "reward." We feel happy when our efforts are rewarded.

For example, think about clearing a really difficult video game, or finally being able to play a song on an instrument after practicing for a long time. That feeling of "I did it!" is exactly what this is.

Conversely, if everything is too easy and can be done with no effort, it's hard to get this sense of accomplishment.

Language is the "Ultimate Challenge" for the Brain
And it seems that learning a language is an incredibly effective "challenge" for activating this reward system.

When we try to communicate in a language we're not used to, our brains work at full capacity. "What's the right word?" "How should I structure this sentence?" We have to think through trial and error.

And when, after all that struggle, your words finally get through to the other person, and you see them nod and say, "I see," the feeling of joy is immense.

Gemini told me that this process is, in a way, like a "mental workout." By putting a high load on our brains, we can feel a great sense of fulfillment.

Inconvenience = A Shortcut to Dopamine
So, what I want to say is that the "inconvenience" of not using AI translation is, in fact, a "shortcut to getting our brains to release dopamine."

By deliberately creating a situation where you "can't easily communicate," you're setting up the best possible stage for feeling a sense of accomplishment.

The app I'm trying to create is designed to provide this "stage." A place where you can communicate with people from different countries, not through the filter of a machine, but with your own raw words.

Of course, there will be times when you can't get your point across and feel frustrated. But it's precisely because of that frustration that the joy of connecting will be all the greater. I want to create a community that can share that feeling.

The Trap of "Efficiency"
In our modern society, "efficiency" is often seen as a virtue. We're always trying to do things faster and with less effort.

Of course, that's important. But if we pursue only efficiency, we might be losing out on the "joy of making an effort."

I think it's also important to have the luxury of deliberately taking the long way around sometimes. The "inconvenience" of language learning is not just a pain; it's a "benefit" that enriches our lives. That's what I believe.

Current Status: Still fumbling around with the basics
Now, for the actual development progress... to be honest, I'm still at the stage of fumbling around with the very basics of Next.js and Firebase.

I'm creating the project structure, trying to figure out how to set up the UI... it's a series of trial and error.

It feels like I'm still at the foot of a very high mountain, but believing that this "difficulty" will eventually lead to a great sense of accomplishment, I'm going to keep moving forward, one step at a time.

I'll be writing more about the specific technical struggles in the next post.

Please look forward to it.
