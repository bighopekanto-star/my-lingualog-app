Hello, I'm Animex, a complete programming novice.

This time, I'll look back on the **"days of mud"** in the early stages of development. This is a raw record from a time when I knew nothing about convenient integrated environments and was just copy-pasting AI suggestions.

Behind the Scenes: Not "seminar" or "plain," but consulting with Gemini
First, my first step in app development. It was telling my dream to Google's AI, "Gemini."

"I want to create an inconvenient calling app that avoids AI translation to learn about different cultures." I passionately explained this concept via voice input, but when I later checked the transcript, it was a storm of mis-transcriptions like "plainly (Jimi) this kind of app" and "I want to make it in a seminar (Zemi)."

(※Behind the scenes: Even as I write this blog, I have an AI check my writing, but maybe these failure stories like "seminar" or "plain" are what I call "human-likeness.")

Anyway, while clearing up the AI's misunderstandings, I learned the technical configuration from Gemini and obtained a weapon called the **AI editor "Cursor."**

The calm despair of "we don't need people"
The experience of using Cursor was a little different from the "感動" (impression) that is often talked about.

I thought "programming = deciphering a code," but as it turned out, it was a repetition of **"give instructions in Japanese → AI suggests code → approve with the Tab key."**

"Do I, a complete novice who doesn't even know where the terminal is, not need to mess with such advanced code?" "I ask Gemini and tell Cursor. What I'm doing is just being a **'talented operator,'** isn't it?"

Rather, it was a feeling close to a kind of **"despair."** The creative work of writing code is so easily taken away from human hands. This must be a sign that the role of humanity is changing, I calmly realized.

The "oops" of the UI and 3 hours of being lost
But such philosophical thoughts were quickly blown away. Because I was still inexperienced even as an "operator."

When typing the code to create the UI (screen) into Cursor, I made a really basic mistake of copy-pasting it into the wrong place.

Naturally, the screen spat out a bright red error, and nothing worked. "I messed up." That's all there was to it.

I copy-pasted the error log to Gemini and asked, "Where should I fix it?" I fixed it as told, and another error appeared. The same thing over and over. In the end, I wasted a precious 3 hours on a single simple mistake.

It was the moment I received the baptism of a programming beginner: "Making a mistake in where you copy-paste is scarier than the content of the code itself."

The death of the ultimate weapon "Cursor" and the AI hell game
After finishing the UI, the next step was implementing the heart of the app, the calling function **"SkyWay."** I was complacent, thinking that setting the integration key would be easy, but I got stuck in a quagmire where the calls wouldn't connect at all.

In the midst of struggling with the AI teaching me old code and my own copy-paste mistakes... a heartless notification appeared on the screen: **"You have exceeded the free tier limit."**

To think that I would lose Cursor, my lifeline, just a few days after starting development.

I desperately tried to use a student discount, but my school email address was rejected by domain authentication, a double tragedy. As a last resort, I had the AI write a "plea email" for support, but the reply I got was a formulaic response that seemed like it was written by an AI.

An email created by an AI, rejected by an AI. I was just caught in the middle of this futile "AI vs AI" loop.

[A final question] Beyond efficiency, will our "passion" remain?
Having lost Cursor, as I was at a loss, I remembered that 3-hour silence. That helpless time when SkyWay wouldn't connect and I was staring at the error logs.

The app I'm trying to create is one that deliberately chooses to be "inefficient." By subtracting "convenience" from communication, I'm trying to bring back "passion."

So, what about us, the ones making the app? If AI shortcuts all the hard work, where will the "passion" and "dedication" we pour into development come from?

Approving code with the Tab key, and throwing errors to the AI. **At the end of such "ultimate efficiency," is there really any meaning left for us students to create apps?**

I won't stop this fight to find that answer.

Next time: To the forbidden "mystery tool"
I, who have lost the ultimate weapon, Cursor. However, to continue development, I turned to **a "different tool."**

Next time, how I broke through the hellish SkyWay implementation using that mystery tool. A complete novice's desperate struggle is far from over.

(To be continued)

Lessons from this time
AI is not "plain," but rather too intense.

Where you copy-paste is more critical than the content of the code.

AI's greatest enemy might be AI itself.
