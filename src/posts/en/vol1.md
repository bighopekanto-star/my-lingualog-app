Well, hello. It's nice to meet you. This is actually the very first post on this blog.

To be honest, I was just talking to Google's AI, Gemini Live, and I'm having it summarize our conversation into an article. You might be thinking, "Leaving it to AI from the very first post?" But, well, I thought it was kind of fitting for our times.

On this blog, I'm going to write, without holding anything back, about my journey as a complete programming novice, battling with AI to create a certain app.

Imagining a post-singularity world made me anxious
You hear about it a lot lately, don't you? "Singularity." A future where AI surpasses human intelligence and does everything automatically.

Honestly, when I imagined it, rather than excitement, I felt a vague sense of anxiety. Of course, it's not like I'm fluent in English or anything, and I appreciate technological advancements.

But if everything becomes too convenient and the communication barrier disappears entirely, what does that mean for us as humans? I started to wonder. Wouldn't the world become too rational, too flawless, and too bland?

(This part is handwritten, but when I was talking with Gemini last Thursday and Friday about the post-singularity future, I felt a real pang in my chest. What particularly struck me was the idea that technology could be created that would overcome our biological limitations. We might be able to understand most things in a matter of seconds, and physical impossibilities might disappear. What goals would such a near-perfect humanity strive for to find happiness? For someone like me who can't be optimistic about such vague anxieties, I was filled with a depressing fear and dread for a while. I've changed my perspective now and don't have those anxieties as much... but I'll write about that in another article.)

What disappears the moment you say "Sister"
The reason I started thinking about this is that I find language personally interesting. Language isn't just an exchange of words; it's a crucial element at the very root of our thoughts.

For example, I felt this when I was learning Spanish in college, it's completely different from Japanese. In Japanese, when you say "姉" (ane, older sister) or "妹" (imouto, younger sister), it's not just "female sibling." It naturally includes nuances of age-based hierarchy and how you should behave. When you're actually speaking Japanese, you tend to choose your words while being mindful of these things.

But in English or other European languages, it's just "sister," and there's a flatness to it that doesn't emphasize age as much.

It's not about which is better or worse, but just by the language being different, the way you perceive the world is completely different. I think language is something that very honestly reflects how people feel and think every day.

If AI-powered automatic translation and simultaneous interpretation become perfect, and "Sister" is unthinkingly converted to "妹" (imouto), I feel like that "cultural scent" or "pattern of thought" will be lost entirely. It feels empty to think that behind the convenience, we'll lose the ability to share those important feelings.

Deliberately "not translating" as a contrarian move
So, the app I want to create is one that goes against the current of the times. A calling app that deliberately avoids AI translation and simultaneous interpretation features.

With today's technology, it might be easy to translate perfectly in real time. But I want to dare to speak with my own mouth, even if my English is clumsy.

There will be moments of silence when you can't find the words, or moments of breaking into a cold sweat wondering, "Was that expression correct?" I think there will be very awkward moments. But I want something where you can enjoy that "difficulty" as well.

Taking the trouble to convey a simple message that a convenient translator could handle in an instant. I believe that it's only when you can share that "struggle" that a true bond between people, transcending countries and cultures, can be born.

I want to create a niche but passionate community where everyone can grow and challenge themselves. "Enjoying the inconvenience" might be the greatest luxury of all.

AI is not the "enemy," but a "tool"
And what's interesting is that while I'm trying to create this "anti-AI translation" app, I'm using AI (like Gemini) to the fullest, including for this very task (lol).

It might sound ironic, but I don't believe AI is good or evil. AI is not the "enemy," nor is it an "accomplice" that will ruin humanity. I think of it purely as a "tool."

A knife can be used to cook a delicious meal, or it can be used to harm someone. It's the same with AI; it all depends on "how you use it." So, I think it's a "winner-take-all" situation.

I don't want to be spoiled by convenience and have the fundamental opportunities for human growth taken away, but using a powerful tool like AI to achieve what I want to do (build a community) is totally acceptable, that's my stance.

Future plans: Witness the struggles of a complete novice
So, there you have it. I'm saying all these lofty things, but in reality, I'm a complete amateur when it comes to development.

From the next post onwards, through this blog, I plan to share in real-time "the process of a complete novice developing an app with AI."

I can't write code, and I don't know much about servers. How will I give it form from that state? I'm sure there will be many hardships ahead, but well, I hope to enjoy even that.

Instead of being swallowed by the wave of singularity, please watch me as I desperately try to swim.

I'll do my best.
