The Despair of "Isn't This Better Off Without Me?"
The development philosophy behind this app was sparked by a sudden realization one day while I was working part-time at a cram school.

It happened when a student asked me a slightly difficult question. I was diligently searching for words to explain it clearly. But then, it suddenly occurred to me: "Isn't this better off without me?"

After all, the rectangular electronic device in their hands contains a conversational AI far smarter than me, capable of providing incredibly clear explanations for free, in just a few seconds.

It wasn't just an inferiority complex; it was a cold, hard understanding of **"structural inevitability."**

If the task is simply to provide "correct answers" or to teach something, humans can no longer beat AI. They don't get tired, and their performance doesn't drop due to emotions. If companies think rationally, "task"-level jobs that don't require taking responsibility will inevitably shift from humans, who are a bottleneck due to labor costs, to vastly cheaper AI. And only a very small number of people who are responsible for the decisions made by AI will remain; everyone else will be eliminated.

Such a future is just around the corner. When I felt that, I fell into an intense identity crisis. "Then, who am I, and what value can I offer to society?"

"Translation Konjac" Comes with Pain
Changing the subject, what do you all think about "Translation Konjac"? Many people would probably think it would be wonderful to be able to talk with people all over the world in their own language and understand each other. As someone from a non-English-speaking country, I myself am one of those who wistfully wish I were as fluent in English as a returnee.

However, I also believe that convenient tool comes with a "pain" that can be overlooked if you're not careful.

Language is the source of thought, and a person's values and culture are deeply rooted in their native tongue. When we painstakingly string together imperfect words, we acutely feel the cultural differences and the consideration for the other person in the background. Fluent translation by AI skips over that "friction in the process of trying to understand each other."

There's a fundamental difference between AI telling us "people of this nationality tend to do this" based on data, and actually talking to a living person and breaking out in a cold sweat because "it's not getting through at all!" Knowledge that cannot be verified is merely information. Isn't it the experience of human contact, including all the noise it entails, that completes true "understanding of others"?

When I considered that, I realized what I should create is a place to preserve that "process that is likely to be skipped over."

The Inevitability Embedded in the Name "Co-Vibe"
I decided on the name **"Co-Vibe"** for the app currently under development.

I had considered other names initially, but I ended up with the words "Co" (together) and "Vibe" (atmosphere/wavelength).

No matter how much AI develops, even if it can perfectly replicate human atmosphere and speech patterns, and even if an AI with an incredibly high EQ (Emotional Quotient) is created, "actual emotions" as an entity cannot exist within it. In contrast, conversations between humans have a unique tension. "What is this person thinking?" "Did I just say something strange?" That anxiety, that fluctuation, the moments of stumbling over words. That atmosphere arises precisely because autonomous subjects are interacting.

That cannot be created alone. It only comes into being through the interaction between two humans – oneself and the other. The existence of the other person is **"inevitable"** for the experience within this app. That's why I added "Co-".

The "contribution" I envision is to bring a sense of happiness to others. Providing convenient things is one form of contribution, but just as there isn't one single most delicious dish in the world, there's no universal form of happiness. That's why I wanted to contribute to someone by providing a space for "humans to talk to each other," which is different from efficiency through AI.

Responsibility is the Flip Side of Freedom
Please don't misunderstand; I'm not trying to oppose convenient apps. Convenience is justice. I use AI too, and I enjoy its benefits. How to use that existence is, rather, our responsibility as users.

This app has neither AI translation nor conversation assistance. The person you're talking to might not be who you're looking for, and the topics might not click. But I believe that simply by choosing to use this app, you already bear responsibility. What you talk about is free, and the awkwardness or friction you accept as a result is also part of the responsibility inseparable from freedom.

I want people who seek the "richness of life" that can be lost amidst convenience to use this app. Instead of easily flowing into the "efficient happiness" enjoyed by many, I want them to think for themselves, act, and uphold their values. This is for those who dare to try something a little troublesome.

In a Rational World, Why Not Deliberately Take the Scenic Route?
In the society of the future, if we pursue rationality to its extreme, many of our human capabilities will be replaced by AI. Nevertheless, what remains at the very end is the value of "humanity," I believe.

If you find more value in imperfect human conversations than in perfect AI answers. Or if you feel like reclaiming the "sense of thinking for yourself and engaging with someone" in an overly convenient world.

Why not start taking a little bit of a scenic route with "Co-Vibe"?

You're welcome to criticize it as a worthy opponent. However, if this philosophy resonates with you in any way, there would be nothing happier for me than if we could nurture this app together as "a place where humanity is preserved."

Someone out there is surely waiting for your imperfect, and precisely because of that, human words.
